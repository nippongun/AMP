# AMP
AMP - short for A Magnificent Program/Player - is an app, NDK, based on the C language which emulates amplifiers for electric guitars

# Introduction
The primary use is for guitar players which do not want to carry heavy amplifiers (amps) - which need plugs anyway - and the ability to use the phone as a simple amp.
This can be extended with pedals, yet this is a far goal.
Abusing this, can cause eerie sounds and might disturb you. 

# Basic principles
Guitars produce an analog electric signal, which gets digitally converted right after the signal passes the input

# Goals
The app should be able to do following:
- catch the audio input
- amplify the signal
- output the signal as an amplfied signal
- intuitive use
- Both audio jack and USB-C should be applicable (iOS is not planned yet)
